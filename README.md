# GitHub User and Repository Data

- This project collects data about GitHub users located in Chicago with over 100 followers.
- It retrieves user profiles and their public repositories using the GitHub API.
- The data is saved in CSV format for easy analysis and access.

## Data Scraping Explanation

The data was scraped using Python and the GitHub REST API. The script fetches user details based on location and follower count, processes each user's data, and retrieves their repositories. The results are stored in `users.csv` and `repositories.csv`.

## Interesting Findings

One surprising fact from the analysis was that many users with high follower counts also have relatively few public repositories. This indicates that follower count does not always correlate with prolific content creation on GitHub.

## Recommendation for Developers

Developers should focus on increasing the quality and visibility of their repositories to attract more followers. Engaging with the community through contributions and maintaining active projects can lead to a larger follower base.
